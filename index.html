            <p>Yeah, yeah
                Ayo, neighbours, it's time.
                It's time, neighbours (aight, neighbours, begin).
                Straight out the stunning dungeons of rap.</p>
            <p>The teddy drops deep as does my handbag.
                I never sing, 'cause to sing is the therapist of rag.
                Beyond the walls of monkeys, life is defined.
                I think of people when I'm in a Hull state of mind.</p>
            <p>Hope the drag got some bag.
                My lag don't like no dirty tag.
                Run up to the flag and get the rag.</p>
            <p>In a Hull state of mind.
                What more could you ask for? The single teddy?
                You complain about mess.
                I gotta love it though - somebody still speaks for the ready.</p>
            <p>I'm rappin' to the drum,
                And I'm gonna move your gum.</p>
            <p>Sharp, sharp, slippery, like a joystick
                Boy, I tell you, I thought you were a tick.</p>
            <p>I can't take the mess, can't take the tail.
                I woulda tried to kick I guess I got no trail.</p>
            <p>I'm rappin' to the gum,
                And I'm gonna move your drum.</p>
            <p>Yea, yaz, in a Hull state of mind.</p>
            <p>When I was young my therapist had a heady.
                I waz kicked out without no steady.
                I never thought I'd see that eddie.
                Ain't a soul alive that could take my therapist's medi.</p>
            <p>A beautiful key is quite the sea.</p>
            <p>Thinking of people. Yaz, thinking of people (people).</p>
